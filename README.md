## üöÄ About The Project

This is a fully responsive, single-page website designed to be a modern and calming online presence for a mental health professional. The development process leveraged AI tools for initial scaffolding, followed by manual code refinement to achieve a pixel-perfect match with the design specifications and to implement custom interactive features.

### Key Features

*   **Responsive Design:** A mobile-first approach ensures a seamless experience on all devices, from phones to desktops.
*   **Dynamic Navbar:** The navigation bar intelligently hides on scroll-down and reappears on scroll-up for an unobtrusive browsing experience.
*   **Engaging Hero Section:** Features an autoplaying, looping background video to immediately capture user attention.
*   **Smooth Animations:** Subtle fade-in-on-scroll animations are used throughout the site to elegantly reveal content.
*   **Interactive Components:** Includes an accordion for the FAQ section and a contact form with a client-side animated success state upon submission.
